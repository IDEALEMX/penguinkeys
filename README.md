# penguinkeys
A fast typing game made in c++ using raylib.

So far this game is still in development and at it's current state is more of a demo than an actual game.
Make file currently only supports the Clang compiler on linux but support for other platforms may be added soon.
Requires Raylib to work, although the it should work, since the requiered files should be included.
